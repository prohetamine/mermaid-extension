# Mermaid Extension

> Mermaid-extension - Automated webcam chat reading and routing between devices and servers. You can control toys, lights, keep [statistics](https://github.com/prohetamine/webcam-token-stat-stream) and much more...

### Why?

I'm tired of the ugliness of all such methods that are made it is unclear for whom and for what, I decided to make a convenient event handler from webcam sites, at the moment there is only chaturbate, but at the first opportunity I will add all possible sites, you can help me, just take part in testing. I need a registered account on other platforms.
